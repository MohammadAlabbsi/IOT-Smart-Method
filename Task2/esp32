Espressif Systems created the ESP32 line of SoCs (System on Chip). They have an integrated Bluetooth module, WiFi, and a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 processor.
It is an extremely intriguing solution for product creators or developers because it was created to have low consumption and low cost.
It comes in a few different forms, ranging from the chip through modules and development boards.
Starting out, using development boards is usually the best choice because it requires the least amount of electronics to maintain the ESP32, which is currently available (despite being really small).
Additionally, these development boards' USB-Serial converters are simple to use, which makes communicating with the ESP32 considerably simpler.
Additional development boards are available.

//Pins connected to the button
int btn1 = 18;
 
//Pins that are wired on the relay module
int rele1 = 33;
int rele2 = 32;
 
//variable to store the state of the second relay
boolean rele2_Ativo = false;


//The setup() function is executed once before the loop
void setup()
{
  //Set button pins as input
  pinMode(btn1, INPUT);
 
  //Set relay pins as output
  pinMode(rele1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(rele2, OUTPUT);
 
  //Opens the serial port, setting the data rate to 9600 bps
  Serial.begin(9600);
}


//The loop() function is executed after setup and is repeated continuously
void loop()
{
  if (digitalRead(btn1) == HIGH) //If button 1 was pressed
  {
    //Display the message in quotes on the serial monitor
    Serial.println("button pressed");
 
    //We turn on relay 1
    digitalWrite(rele1, HIGH);
 
    //We invert the state of the variable relay2_Ativo
    rele2_Ativo = !rele2_Ativo;
 
    //We change the state of relay 2
    digitalWrite(rele2, rele2_Ativo );
 
    //We wait 1 second (1000 ms)
    delay(1000);
 
    //We turn off relay 1
    digitalWrite(rele1, LOW);
  }
}
